# Document-Analysis
"Combination of document/article analysis and question answering system"

The purpose of this project is to analyze medical research articles while simultaneously allowing the user the freedom to conduct question-and-answer sessions (QnA) over the text. This project's major goal is to use massive language models (GPT3) throughout the early stages of drug development. Due to my interest in drug development—normally, any researcher working on a discovery would focus on comparing medications for a therapeutic area—I came up with this initiative. This will confirm the efficacies and compare the reproducibility of the medications described in research articles. Desk research is a time-consuming task that calls for knowledge of the biomedical research field.  For an intended use case, a person must read several papers, make notes, and then draw a conclusion. This project aims to brief (summarize) the user on the paper and provides features like the number of drugs mentioned in the paper, advantages and disadvantages of the drug in relation to the context of the paper, drug comparison, table summarization, and biomarker extraction in order to reduce time consumption and manual efforts. The user will also be asked pertinent questions via the website's QnA area in addition to that. 

For this project I have fetched PUBMED articles as a source of my biomedical research papers.

The Document Analysis has few subsections i.e 
- Drug names mentioned in the paper 
- Advantages and disadvantages of drugs 
- Comparison of drugs 
- Table Analysis  
- Biomarker detection
